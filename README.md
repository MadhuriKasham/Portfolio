 > Resource: https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-nginx-server-windows/#example
  
To start the NGINX SERVER ON A WINDOWS LOCAL MACHINE that already has the Nginx webserver installed, follow these steps:

  > Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator. 
  
  > Share the folder path to Nginx. The folder should contain conf, contrib, docs, html, logs, temp, and nginx.exe files.
  
  > Start the Nginx server on Windows by running the command start nginx.
  
  > Open the web browser and type "localhost" in the search bar. If a proxy is being used in the conf file, type "127.0.0.1" instead.
  
  > The website should be served as per the request.

  > To quit the Nginx server on Windows, run the command .\nginx -s quit.
